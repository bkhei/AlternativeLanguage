- Why did I pick Ruby for this Project?

  **I chose Ruby as the syntax was more simple compared to languages like C# or Java, and it has more built-in use for processing text. Ruby is also an object oriented language and contans libraries that makes it easy to read CSV files into classes/objects.**
  
- How does Ruby handle object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling?
 
  **Ruby is completely object-oriented, which meant it was perfect for this type of project. It handles file-ingestion well and only really needs different libraries depending on what you intend to ingest. You can create functions to write to CSVs as well, as I did in this project for testing. Ruby has the same conditionals and assignments as Python sort of has, and I feel like the loops were easier to read compared to Python. With our functions/methods, Ruby has a lot of stuff built-in that sort of handles what I wanted to accomplish for this project. You can define methods in classes, create different methods for converting to strings inside of the class, and even look for unique values within class objects...**
  
- List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.

  **CSV, alongside the descriptive_statistics and write_xlsx library. The CSV library is mandatory for even reading CSV files in the first place, and the write_xlsx I actually had to install a Ruby Gem for in order to use. I didn't really get much use out of it in terms of formatting it as an Excel file and ended up writing it as a CSV anyways, but in the future maybe I can format it properly so it can be written as one without any errors or corruptions. The descriptive_statistics is useful for calculating basic descriptive statistics of numeric sample data in Ruby. We can get means, sums, medians, etc which was useful for answering the following questions.**

- Answer the following questions (and provide a corresponding screen showing output answering them):
  1) What company (oem) has the highest average weight of the phone body?\
  **TBA**
  2) Was there any phones that were announced in one year and released in another? What are they? Give me the oem and models.\
  **TBA**
  3) How many phones have only one feature sensor?\
  **TBA**
  4) What year had the most phones launched in any year later than 1999?\
  **2019**
